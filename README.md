A consumer finance company specializing in urban loans faces challenges in approving loans for individuals without sufficient credit history, risking financial losses from defaults. 
The company aims to minimize these risks through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to make informed loan approval decisions.

The company confronts the dilemma of distinguishing creditworthy applicants from potential defaulters due to insufficient credit histories. 
The provided dataset includes information on loan applications, highlighting clients with payment difficulties and those with timely payments. 
The focus is to identify patterns that influence loan default risks.

The challenge is to employ EDA to find patterns that help identify applicants likely to repay or default on loans, thereby guiding the company's loan approval decisions. 
The objective is to discover key indicators of loan default, enabling the company to manage its loan portfolio and assess risks effectively, and decide on appropriate actions such as loan denial and identifying fraud.
